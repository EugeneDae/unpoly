  URL patterns
  ============

  Some Unpoly features like `a[up-alias]` let you match any URL with a given pattern.

  For this matching Unpoly does *not* use regular expressions, but the URL pattern format outlined below.

  \#\#\# Matching an exact URL

  Pass any absolute path or fully qualified URL to only match this exact value:

  ```text
  /users/new
  ```

  \#\#\# Matching with wildcards

  Append an asterisk (`*`) to any path to match all URLs with that prefix:

  ```text
  /users/*
  ```

  Prepend an asterisk to match all URLs with that suffix:

  ```text
  */edit
  ```

  You may also infix an asterisk to match URLs with the given prefix and suffix:

  ```text
  /admin/*/edit
  ```

  \#\#\# Matching one of multiple alternatives

  To match one of multiple URLs or patterns, separate the alternatives by a space.

  The following will match either `/users/123` or `/account`:

  ```text
  /users/* /account
  ```

  JavaScript functions that take URL patterns will accept multiple patterns
  as either a space-separated string or as an array of patterns:

  ```js
  up.layer.open({ acceptLocation: '/users/* /account')
  up.layer.open({ acceptLocation: ['/users/*', '/account'])
  ```

  \#\#\# Excluding patterns

  To exclude an URL or pattern, prefix with a minus.

  The following will match `/users/alice` but not `/users/new`:

  ```text
  /users/* -/users/new
  ```

  \#\#\# Capturing named segments

  It is sometimes useful to capture the value of a wildcard match, e.g. to
  [close an overlay once a location is reached](/up.layer.open#options.acceptLocation).

  The following will capture `{ name: 'alice' }` from the path `/users/alice`:

  ```text
  /users/:name
  ```

  To only match digits (`0-9`), use the dollar symbol:

  ```text
  /users/:$id
  ```
