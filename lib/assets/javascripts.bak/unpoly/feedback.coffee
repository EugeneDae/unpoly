Navigation feedback
===================

The `up.feedback` module adds useful CSS classes to links while they are loading,
or when they point to the current URL.

By styling these classes you may provide instant feedback to user interactions,
improving the perceived speed of your interface.


\#\#\# Example

Let's say we have an `<nav>` element with two links, pointing to `/foo` and `/bar` respectively:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/foo" up-follow>Foo</a>
  <a href="/bar" up-follow>Bar</a>
</nav>
```

By giving the navigation bar the `[up-nav]` attribute, links pointing to the current browser address are highlighted
as we navigate through the site.

If the current URL is `/foo`, the first link is automatically marked with an [`.up-current`](/a.up-current) class:

```html
<nav up-nav>
  <a href="/foo" up-follow class="up-current">Foo</a>
  <a href="/bar" up-follow>Bar</a>
</nav>
```

When the user clicks on the `/bar` link, the link will receive the [`up-active`](/a.up-active) class while it is waiting
for the server to respond:

```
<nav up-nav>
  <a href="/foo" up-follow class="up-current">Foo</a>
  <a href="/bar" up-follow class="up-active">Bar</a>
</div>
```

Once the response is received the URL will change to `/bar` and the `up-active` class is removed:

```html
<nav up-nav>
  <a href="/foo" up-follow>Foo</a>
  <a href="/bar" up-follow class="up-current">Bar</a>
</nav>
```

  ###**
  Marks the given element as currently loading, by assigning the CSS class [`up-active`](/a.up-active).

  This happens automatically when following links or submitting forms through the Unpoly API.
  Use this function if you make custom network calls from your own JavaScript code.

  If the given element is a link within an [expanded click area](/up-expand),
  the class will be assigned to the expanded area.

  \#\#\# Example

      var button = document.querySelector('button')

      button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        up.feedback.start(button)
        up.request(...).then(() => {
          up.feedback.stop(button)
        })
      })

  @function up.feedback.start
  @param {Element} element
    The element to mark as active
  @internal
  ###
  start = (element) ->
    findActivatableArea(element).classList.add(CLASS_ACTIVE)

  ###**
  Links that are currently [loading through Unpoly](/a-up-follow)
  are assigned the `.up-active` class automatically.

  Style `.up-active` in your CSS to improve the perceived responsiveness
  of your user interface.

  The `.up-active` class will be removed when the link is done loading.

  \#\#\# Example

  We have a link:

  ```html
  <a href="/foo" up-follow>Foo</a>
  ```

  The user clicks on the link. While the request is loading,
  the link has the `up-active` class:

  ```html
  <a href="/foo" up-follow class="up-active">Foo</a>
  ```

  Once the link destination has loaded and rendered, the `.up-active` class
  is removed and the [`.up-current`](/a.up-current) class is added:

  ```html
  <a href="/foo" up-follow class="up-current">Foo</a>
  ```

  @selector a.up-active
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  Forms that are currently [loading through Unpoly](/form-up-submit)
  are assigned the `.up-active` class automatically.
  Style `.up-active` in your CSS to improve the perceived responsiveness
  of your user interface.

  The `.up-active` class will be removed as soon as the response to the
  form submission has been received.

  \#\#\# Example

  We have a form:

  ```html
  <form up-target=".foo">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```

  The user clicks on the submit button. While the form is being submitted
  and waiting for the server to respond, the form has the `up-active` class:

  ```html
  <form up-target=".foo" class="up-active">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```

  Once the link destination has loaded and rendered, the `.up-active` class
  is removed.

  @selector form.up-active
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  Marks the given element as no longer loading, by removing the CSS class [`.up-active`](/a.up-active).

  This happens automatically when network requests initiated by the Unpoly API have completed.
  Use this function if you make custom network calls from your own JavaScript code.

  @function up.feedback.stop
  @param {Element} element
    The link or form that has finished loading.
  @internal
  ###
  stop = (element) ->
    findActivatableArea(element).classList.remove(CLASS_ACTIVE)

  around = (element, fn) ->
    start(element)
    result = fn()
    u.always(result, -> stop(element))
    return result

  aroundForOptions = (options, fn) ->
    if feedbackOpt = options.feedback
      if u.isBoolean(feedbackOpt)
        element = options.origin
      else
        element = feedbackOpt

    if element
      # In case we get passed a selector or jQuery collection as { origin }
      # or { feedback }, unwrap it with up.fragment.get().
      element = up.fragment.get(element)

      return around(element, fn)
    else
      return fn()


  ###**
  Marks this element as a navigation component, such as a menu or navigation bar.

  When a link within an `[up-nav]` element points to [its layer's location](/up.layer.location),
  it is assigned the [`.up-current`](/a.up-current) class. When the browser navigates to another location, the class is removed automatically.

  You may also assign `[up-nav]` to an individual link instead of an navigational container.

  If you don't want to manually add this attribute to every navigational element,
  you can configure selectors to automatically match your navigation components in `up.feedback.config.navSelectors`.


  \#\#\# Example

  Let's take a simple menu with two links. The menu has been marked with the `[up-nav]` attribute:

  ```html
  <div up-nav>
    <a href="/foo">Foo</a>
    <a href="/bar">Bar</a>
  </div>
  ```

  If the browser location changes to `/foo`, the first link is marked as `.up-current`:

  ```html
  <div up-nav>
    <a href="/foo" class="up-current">Foo</a>
    <a href="/bar">Bar</a>
  </div>
  ```

  If the browser location changes to `/bar`, the first link automatically loses its `.up-current` class. Now the second link is marked as `.up-current`:

  ```html
  <div up-nav>
    <a href="/foo">Foo</a>
    <a href="/bar" class="up-current">Bar</a>
  </div>
  ```


  \#\#\# When is a link "current"?

  When no [overlay](/up.layer) is open, the current location is the URL displayed
  in the browser's address bar. When the link in question is placed in an overlay,
  the current location is the location of that overlay, even if that
  overlay doesn't have [visible history](/up.Layer.prototype.history).

  A link matches the current location (and is marked as `.up-current`) if it matches either:

  - the link's `[href]` attribute
  - the link's `[up-href]` attribute
  - the URL pattern in the link's [`[up-alias]`](/a-up-alias) attribute

  @selector [up-nav]
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  Links within `[up-nav]` may use the `[up-alias]` attribute to pass a [URL pattern](/url-patterns) for which they
  should also be highlighted as [`.up-current`](/a.up-current).

  \#\#\# Example

  The link below will be highlighted with `.up-current` at both `/profile` and `/profile/edit` locations:

  ```html
  <div up-nav>
    <a href="/profile" up-alias="/profile/edit">Profile</a>
  </div>
  ```

  To pass more than one alternative URLs, use a [URL pattern](/url-patterns).

  @selector a[up-alias]
  @param up-alias
    A [URL pattern](/url-patterns) with alternative URLs.
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  When a link within an `[up-nav]` element points to the current location, it is assigned the `.up-current` class.

  See [`[up-nav]`](/up-nav) for more documentation and examples.

  @selector a.up-current
