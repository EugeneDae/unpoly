    # Let's talk about our choice of @element for the root layer.
    #
    # 1. We don't want to use `document`, since that is for our global event bus.
    #    For instance, take a look how up.Change.CloseLayer emits the up:layer:dismiss
    #    event first on `@layer.element`, then on `document`.
    #    Also `document` is not really an element, just an event target.
    # 2. We want but cannot use <body> element. Since Unpoly boots before
    #    the DOM is ready, document.body is still undefined. We also cannot delay
    #    booting until the DOM is ready, since by then all user-defined event listeners
    #    and compilers will have registered.
    # 3. That leaves the <html> element, which is available before the DOM is ready
    #    on Chrome, Firefox, IE11, Safari.
    # 4. A nice benefit of using <html> is that up.fragment.get('html', layer: 'root')
    #    will yield a result.
