  Returns whether this browser supports manipulation of the current URL
  via [`history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState).

  When `pushState`  (e.g. through [`up.follow()`](/up.follow)), it will gracefully
  fall back to a full page load.

  Note that Unpoly will not use `pushState` if the initial page was loaded with
  a request method other than GET.

  function canPushState() {
    // We cannot use pushState if the initial request method is a POST for two reasons:
    //
    // 1. Unpoly replaces the initial state so it can handle the pop event when the
    //    user goes back to the initial URL later. If the initial request was a POST,
    //    Unpoly will wrongly assumed that it can restore the state by reloading with GET.
    //
    // 2. Some browsers have a bug where the initial request method is used for all
    //    subsequently pushed states. That means if the user reloads the page on a later
    //    GET state, the browser will wrongly attempt a POST request.
    //    This issue affects Safari 9 and 10 (last tested in 2017-08).
    //    Modern Firefoxes, Chromes and IE10+ don't have this behavior.
    //
    // The way that we work around this is that we don't support pushState if the
    // initial request method was anything other than GET (but allow the rest of the
    // Unpoly framework to work). This way Unpoly will fall back to full page loads until
    // the framework was booted from a GET request.
